  "summary" : "<p>I’m passionate about software development, something that started well before I began my studies and my career. One of my strengths is that I am a self-directed learner: I've perfected my skills through my studies and experiences. I never shy away from new challenges.</p><p>I started my studies in Telecom and Network, but I shifted quickly to Software Development. Java technologies became my speciality and I started my career in the development of e-commerce solutions. Most of the solutions I’ve been involved in were built on top of Oracle ATG Web Commerce. As a developper I had to work on every stack of the application: from the back-end integration to the front-end development by way of third party integration.</p><p>I’ve been an IT consultant for the last seven years. Thanks to the diversity of the mandates I’ve been assigned, I've gained a lot of experience. I quickly became team leader, and also had software architecture mandates. My current experience with CGI has reinforced my knowledge of development process, particularly through the usage of agile methodologies. </p><p>During the last year, my interest in javascript development has grown. This started with a project for charter.com. We redeveloped the checkout flow of this site with AngularJS: I’ve been amazed by the way it can improve User Experience. I’ve discovered many possibilities offered by future standard (ES6 and 7) and decided to explore this subject further in my own time.</p>",
